Todo List as of 5-3-2021
    - Add in support for inlining functions
    - Rework Symbol Table code
        - Want to separate out symbol flag groups (kind, type, storage, misc)
        - Want to potentially add separate lists for each symbol kind (vars, consts, types, functions)
    - Rework comparison logic
    - Add in type checking
    - Add in support to handle 16-bit expressions
    - Support other 6502-based machines
        - Already have some code in place to handle multiple machines
            Currently set to handle Atari 2600 base machine only

  LOW PRIORITY
    - Simplify tokenizer
    - Toss out preprocessor?  (only used for including other code modules)
    - Potentially create module system

  BIG TASKS
    - Handle bank-switching
    - Handle split RAM access (separate read/write areas)
    - Handle code layout
        - Already have some code in place (separate code/data blocks)
        - Page alignment
        - Potentially allow user to specify layout
